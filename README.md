# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Telecom Customer Churn Prediction** project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn — i.e., whether a customer is likely to leave the telecom service.

The dataset contains information on **7,043 customers** from a telecommunications company.  
Each record represents one customer and includes details about their **'cap-shape', 'cap-surface', 'cap-color', 'bruises', 'odor',
       'gill-attachment', 'gill-spacing', 'gill-size', 'gill-color',
       'stalk-shape', 'stalk-root', 'stalk-surface-above-ring',
       'stalk-surface-below-ring', 'stalk-color-above-ring',
       'stalk-color-below-ring', 'veil-type', 'veil-color', 'ring-number',
       'ring-type', 'spore-print-color', 'population', 'habitat'** (eatable, poisness).

## 🧠 Libraries Used

The following essential libraries were utilized for data manipulation, visualization, model building, and evaluation:

* **`numpy`**: Fundamental package for scientific computing and array operations.
* **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **`seaborn`** & **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.
* **`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`**: To split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* **`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`**, **`plot_tree`**, **`export_text`**: For model training and visualization of the resulting decision tree.
* **`sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay`** & **`score`**: For model performance evaluation.
* **`sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder`**: To convert categorical features into a numerical format.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

The project followed a systematic approach to model development:

1.  **Data Import and Initial Assessment**: Loading the dataset and examining its structure.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, checking for missing values, and visualizing key feature distributions.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: Handling categorical variables (using **LabelEncoder**) and preparing features for the model.
4.  **Data Splitting**: Dividing the cleaned data into training and testing sets.
5.  **Model Training**: Fitting the **Decision Tree Classifier** to the training data.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using metrics like **accuracy score** and displaying the **confusion matrix**.
7.  **Feature Importance and Optimization**: Analyzing feature contributions and considering potential model tuning.

## ⚙️ Model and Algorithm

### **Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Classifier** 🌳

* The machine learning model chosen for this prediction task is the **Decision Tree Classifier** from `scikit-learn`.
* The model is trained based on the **entropy** criterion, which measures the impurity or randomness of the data to guide the optimal splitting of nodes in the tree. This helps in building a tree that provides the most information gain at each split, leading to better classification of churn and non-churn customers.
