# ðŸ“Š Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
The **Telecom Customer Churn Prediction** project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn â€” i.e., whether a customer is likely to leave the telecom service.

The dataset contains information on **7,043 customers** from a telecommunications company.  
Each record represents one customer and includes details about their **demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, and churn status** (joined, stayed, or churned).
